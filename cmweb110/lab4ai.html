<h3>What did you think of this AI experiment? </h3>
<p>I thought it was awesome. I love using AI as a tool not as a source of cheating or laziness.</p>
<h3>Did it work well? </h3>
<p>I thought it worked very well!</p>
<h3>Did you have to redo the question to the AI? If so, what question did you use?</h3>
<p>No, it did everything as it was supposed to.</p>
<h3>Would you use AI to generate code again?</h3>
<p>Absolutely! I feel that AI can be a tool to help you understand how to move forward if you get stuck. I don't think AI should be viewed as a bad thing, if it is used correctly.</p>
